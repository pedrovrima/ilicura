# WikiMudas (codename Ilicura)

Wikimudas is a webapp (PWA-enabled) designed as a way of sharing and easily accessing information on how to age and sex birds in the hand (for bird banders). Right now the data available is from only one source, but the plan is to make it a wiki-like program and receive contributions from different research institutions.

## Roadmap

WikiMudas was build in a 2 month sprint and has some technical debt as well as some UI issues.

To-do list: 

1- Improve Admin Mode UI
2- Add auth for admin mode
3- Improve images in offline mode
4- Implement approval system
5- Create extra pages with basic information about the app, ageing and molting birds
